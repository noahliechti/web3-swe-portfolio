### Problem Statement
I want to build a personal portfolio where I can showcase projects and people can connect with me.
### Approach
My approach is to only use native tools. In addition I want to offer fast loading speeds and a great UX.
#### Stack
- VanillaJS
- CSS3
- HTML5
#### Architecture
I decided to go with a static webpage, that gets rendered on the server-side. This enables a fast initial load and the crawlers can directly parse the information (SEO).
#### UX/UI
### Challenges
It was challenging for my to decide in the beginning what technologies I want to use Building an app from scratch was an unusual task. Nevertheless I wanted a solid foundation.

### Solutions
#### Bundl: Webpack vs Rollup vs Parcel
I decided to go with Parcel for reasons XY.
