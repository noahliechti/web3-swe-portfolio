### Problem Statement
I want to build a personal portfolio where I can showcase projects and people can connect with me.
### Approach
My approach is to only use native tools. In addition I want to offer fast loading speeds and a great UX. The page should be accessible and look the same on every browser. There will be no support for IE 11 and Opera Mini. I went with a mobile-first approach.
#### Stack
- ES2015 JavaScript
- CSS3
- HTML5
#### Architecture
I decided to go with a static webpage. There was just no need for something dynamic. In addition my website will be fast and SEO friendly out the box

### Solutions

I decided to go with Parcel for reasons XY.
